# RETRO GAME - Touch-Me!

## Introduction
### Full Stack Developer Course: Milestone 2 project.

The brief was to design an interactive front end website.

The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

#### Value provided:
Users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their personal goals and derive answers to their specific questions.
The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves.

## Design Development 
One idea suggested was to create 'The Simon Game'. I did a little bit of research into this and found that the Simon game was based on an old Atari arcade game that never really took off. Whilst looking at this I was taken with the imagery of the arcade game and the hand held device and decided that I would like to recreate this.
